# ARTICLE I

## CORPORATE OFFICES

**1.1.Offices**

    In addition to the corporation's registered office set forth in the certificate of incorporation, the Board of
    Directors may at any time establish other offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do
    business.

## ARTICLE II

### MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

**2.1.Place Of Meetings**

    Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place, within or outside the state of Delaware, designated by
    the Board of Directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders' meetings shall be held at the
    registered office of the corporation.

**2.2.Annual Meeting**

    The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on such date, time and place, either within or without the
    state of Delaware, as may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors each year. At the meeting,
    directors shall be elected and any other proper business may be transacted.

**2.3.Special Meeting**

    A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the chairperson of
    the board, the chief executive officer, the president or by one or more stockholders holding shares in the aggregate
    entitled to cast not less than 10% of the votes at that meeting.

    If a special meeting is called by any person or persons other than the Board of Directors, the chairperson of
    the board, the chief executive officer or the president, the request shall be in writing, specifying the time of such
    meeting and the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent
    by registered mail or by email, fax, telegraphic or other facsimile or electronic transmission to the chairperson of
    the board, the chief executive officer, the president or the secretary of the corporation. No business may be
    transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The officer receiving the request shall
    cause notice to be promptly given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of
    Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of this Article II, that a meeting will be held at the time requested by the person or persons
    calling the meeting, not less than 35 nor more than 60 days after the receipt of the request. If the notice is not
    given within 20 days after the receipt of the request, the person or persons requesting the meeting may give the
    notice. Nothing contained in this paragraph of this Section 2.3 shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting
    the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board of Directors may be held.

**2.4.Notice Of Stockholders' Meetings**

    All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing and shall be sent or otherwise given in
    accordance with Section 2.5 of these bylaws not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting
    to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notice shall specify the place (if any), date and hour of
    the meeting, and in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.

**2.5.Manner Of Giving Notice; Affidavit Of Notice**

    Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail,
    postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. Without
    limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to
    stockholders may be given by electronic mail or other electronic transmission, in the manner provided in Section
    232 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the
    transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie
    evidence of the facts stated therein.

**2.6.Quorum**

    The holders of a majority of the shares of stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in
    person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of
    business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is
    not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (a) the chairperson of the meeting or (b)
    holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall have
    power to adjourn the meeting to another place (if any), date or time.

**2.7.Adjourned Meeting; Notice**

    When a meeting is adjourned to another place (if any), date or time, unless these bylaws otherwise require,
    notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place (if any), thereof and the means of remote
    communications (if any) by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present and vote at such
    adjourned meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the
    corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
    is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice
    of the place (if any), date and time of the adjourned meeting and the means of remote communications (if any) by
    which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting
    shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

**2.8.Organization; Conduct of Business**

    Such person as the Board of Directors may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, the chief
    executive officer, or in his or her absence, the president or, in his or her absence, such person as may be chosen by
    the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order
    any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairperson of the meeting. In the absence of the secretary of the
    corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairperson of the meeting appoints.

    The chairperson of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at
    the meeting, including the manner of voting and the conduct of business. The date and time of opening and closing
    of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the
    meeting.

**2.9.Voting**

    The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the
    provisions of Section 2.12 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the Delaware
    General Corporation Law (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting
    trusts and other voting agreements).

    Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to
    one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder. All elections shall be determined by a plurality
    of the votes cast, and except as otherwise required by law, all other matters shall be determined by a majority of
    the votes cast affirmatively or negatively.

**2.10.Waiver Of Notice**

    Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or of
    the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or
    waiver by electronic mail or other electronic transmission by such person, whether before or after the time stated
    therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
    notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
    beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
    convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
    stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, or any waiver of notice by electronic transmission,
    unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

**2.11.Stockholder Action By Written Consent Without A Meeting**

    Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or
    special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special
    meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a
    consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is (a) signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not
    less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
    which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and (b) delivered to the corporation in accordance
    with Section 228(a) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

    Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no
    written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the date
    the earliest dated consent is delivered to the corporation, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient
    number of holders to take action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed in this Section. A
    telegram, cablegram, electronic mail or other electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and
    transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or
    proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for purposes of this Section to the extent permitted
    by law. Any such consent shall be delivered in accordance with Section 228(d)(1) of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law.

    Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu
    of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such
    copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.

    Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
    shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing (including by electronic mail or other
    electronic transmission as permitted by law). If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the
    filing of a certificate under any section of the Delaware General Corporation Law if such action had been voted on
    by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any
    statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent

    have been given as provided in Section 228 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

**2.12.Record Date For Stockholder Notice; Voting; Giving Consents**

    In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of
    stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a
    meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled
    to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other
    lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60 nor less
    than 10 days before the date of such meeting, nor more than 60 days prior to any other action.

    If the Board of Directors does not so fix a record date:
    a. The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
    stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or,
    if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

    b. The record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing
    without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is necessary, shall be the day on which the
    first written consent (including consent by electronic mail or other electronic transmission as permitted by
    law) is delivered to the corporation.

    c. The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business
    on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

    A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall
    apply to any adjournment of the meeting, if such adjournment is for 30 days or less; provided, however, that the
    Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

**2.13.Proxies**

    Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate
    action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by an
    instrument in writing or by an electronic transmission permitted by law filed with the secretary of the corporation,
    but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a
    longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder's name is placed on the proxy (whether by
    manual signature, typewriting, facsimile, electronic or telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder
    or the stockholder's attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be
    governed by the provisions of Section 212(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

# ARTICLE III

# DIRECTORS

**3.1.Powers**

    Subject to the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and any limitations in the certificate of
    incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding
    shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by
    or under the direction of the Board of Directors.

**3.2.Number Of Directors**

    The number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors is one (1). This number may be changed

    by a resolution of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders, subject to Section 3.4 of these bylaws. No
    reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before such
    director's term of office expires.

**3.3.Election, Qualification And Term Of Office Of Directors**

    Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, and unless otherwise provided in the certificate of
    incorporation, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual
    meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws,
    wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director, including a director elected to fill a
    vacancy, shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or
    removal.

    Unless otherwise specified in the certificate of incorporation, elections of directors need not be by written
    ballot.

**3.4.Resignation And Vacancies**

    Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the attention of the Secretary of the corporation.
    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 223(a)(1) and 223(a)(2) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, any
    vacancy or newly created directorship may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office (including any
    directors that have tendered a resignation effective at a future date), though less than a quorum, or by a sole
    remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their
    successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced; provided, however, that where such
    vacancy or newly created directorship occurs among the directors elected by the holders of a class or series of
    stock, the holders of shares of such class or series may override the Board of Directors' action to fill such vacancy
    or newly created directorship by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy or newly created
    directorship at a meeting of the corporation's stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders
    hold a sufficient number of shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders.

    If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in
    office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or
    other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special
    meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or
    may apply to the Court of Chancery for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Section 211 of the
    Delaware General Corporation Law.

    If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute
    less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the Court of
    Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the total number of the
    shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to
    fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in
    office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Section 211 of the Delaware General
    Corporation Law as far as applicable.

**3.5.Place Of Meetings; Meetings By Telephone**

    The Board of Directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or
    outside the state of Delaware.

    Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the Board of
    Directors, or any committee designated by the Board of Directors, may participate in a meeting of the Board of
    Directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of
    which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall
    constitute presence in person at the meeting.

**3.6.Regular Meetings**

    Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as
    shall from time to time be determined by the board.

**3.7.Special Meetings; Notice**

    Special meetings of the Board of Directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the
    chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, the secretary or any two directors.

    Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be delivered personally or by telephone to each director
    or sent by first-class mail, facsimile, electronic transmission, or telegram, charges prepaid, addressed to each
    director at that director's address as it is shown on the records of the corporation. If the notice is mailed, it shall be
    deposited in the United States mail at least 4 days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is
    delivered personally or by facsimile, electronic transmission, telephone or telegram, it shall be delivered at least 24
    hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be
    communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice
    has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose of the
    meeting. The notice need not specify the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal
    executive office of the corporation. Unless otherwise indicated in the notice thereof, any and all business may be
    transacted at a special meeting.

**3.8.Quorum**

    At all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the total number of duly elected directors then in
    office (but in no case less than 1/3 of the total number of authorized directors) shall constitute a quorum for the
    transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum
    shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the
    certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, then the directors
    present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
    meeting, until a quorum is present.

    A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the
    withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that
    meeting.

**3.9.Waiver Of Notice**

    Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or of
    the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or
    waiver by electronic mail or other electronic transmission by such person, whether before or after the time stated
    therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of
    notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the
    beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
    convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
    directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so
    required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

**3.10.Board Action By Written Consent Without A Meeting**

    Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or
    permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without
    a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic

    transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of
    proceedings of the board or committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper
    form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.

    Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu
    of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such
    copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.

**3.11.Fees And Compensation Of Directors**

    Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the Board of Directors shall
    have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. No such compensation shall preclude any director from
    serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

**3.12.Approval Of Loans To Officers**

    The corporation may lend money to, or guarantee any obligation of, or otherwise assist any officer or other
    employee of the corporation or of its subsidiary, including any officer or employee who is a director of the
    corporation or its subsidiary, whenever, in the judgment of the directors, such loan, guaranty or assistance may
    reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation. The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without
    interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including,
    without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to deny,
    limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute.

**3.13.Removal Of Directors**

    Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, any director or
    the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the
    holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given either at a
    special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders,
    and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock represented at the
    meeting or pursuant to written consent; provided, however, that if the stockholders of the corporation are entitled
    to cumulative voting, if less than the entire Board of Directors is to be removed, no director may be removed
    without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at
    an election of the entire Board of Directors.

    No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the
    expiration of such director's term of office.

**3.14.Chairperson Of The Board Of Directors**

    The corporation may also have, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, a chairperson of the Board of
    Directors who shall not be considered an officer of the corporation.

## ARTICLE IV

### COMMITTEES

**4.1.Committees Of Directors**

    The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more of
    the directors of the corporation. The Board may designate 1 or more directors as alternate members of any
    committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence

    or disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not
    disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint
    another member of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified
    member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors, or in these
    bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of
    the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers
    which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority in reference to the following
    matters: (i) approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required
    by the General Corporate Law of Delaware to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (ii) adopting, amending
    or repealing any Bylaw of the corporation.

**4.2.Committee Minutes**

    Each committee shall keep regular minutes of its meetings and report the same to the Board of Directors
    when required.

**4.3.Meetings And Action Of Committees**

    Meetings and actions of committees shall be governed by, and held and taken in accordance with, the
    provisions of Section 3.5 (place of meetings and meetings by telephone), Section 3.6 (regular meetings), Section
    3.7 (special meetings and notice), Section 3.8 (quorum), Section 3.9 (waiver of notice), and Section 3.10 (action
    without a meeting) of these bylaws, with such changes in the context of such provisions as are necessary to
    substitute the committee and its members for the Board of Directors and its members; provided, however, that the
    time of regular meetings of committees may be determined either by resolution of the Board of Directors or by
    resolution of the committee, that special meetings of committees may also be called by resolution of the Board of
    Directors and that notice of special meetings of committees shall also be given to all alternate members, who shall
    have the right to attend all meetings of the committee. The Board of Directors may adopt rules for the government
    of any committee not inconsistent with the provisions of these bylaws.

## ARTICLE V

    vice presidents, one or more assistant secretaries, one or more assistant treasurers, and any such other officers as

    may from time to time determine.

**5.4.Removal And Resignation Of Officers**

    Subject to the rights (if any) of an officer under any contract of employment, any officer may be removed,
    either with or without cause, by an affirmative vote of the majority of the Board of Directors at any regular or
    special meeting of the board or, except in the case of an officer chosen by the Board of Directors, by any officer
    upon whom the power of removal is conferred by the Board of Directors.

    Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice to the corporation. Any resignation shall take
    effect at the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later time specified in that notice; and, unless otherwise
    specified in that notice, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. Any
    resignation is without prejudice to the rights (if any) of the corporation under any contract to which the officer is a

    officers of the corporation and shall have the general powers and duties of management usually vested in the
    office of chief executive officer of a corporation and shall have such other powers and duties as may be prescribed

    other duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors or by these bylaws.

## ARTICLE VI

### INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND OTHER AGENTS

**6.1.Indemnification Of Directors And Officers**

    The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the Delaware General
    Corporation Law, indemnify each of its directors and officers against expenses (including attorneys' fees),
    judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any
    proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of
    this Section 6.1, a "director" or "officer" of the corporation includes any person (a) who is or was a director or
    officer of the corporation, (b) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director or officer of
    another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or (c) who was a director or officer of a
    corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such
    predecessor corporation.

**6.2.Indemnification Of Others**

    The corporation shall have the power, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by the Delaware
    General Corporation Law, to indemnify each of its employees and agents (other than directors and officers)
    against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and
    reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an
    agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.2, an "employee" or "agent" of the corporation (other than
    a director or officer) includes any person (a) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (b) who is or
    was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
    venture, trust or other enterprise, or (c) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor
    corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation.

**6.3.Payment Of Expenses In Advance**

    Expenses incurred in defending any action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to
    Section 6.1 or for which indemnification is permitted pursuant to Section 6.2 following authorization thereof by
    the Board of Directors shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action or
    proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall
    ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that the
    indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article VI.

**6.4.Indemnity Not Exclusive**

    The indemnification provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
    those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
    directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding
    such office, to the extent that such additional rights to indemnification are authorized in the certificate of
    incorporation.

**6.5.Insurance**

    The corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director,
    officer, employee or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director,
    officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
    liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, or arising out of his or her
    status as such, whether or not the corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such liability
    under the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

**6.6.Conflicts**

    No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Article VI, except where such indemnification or
    advance is mandated by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, in any
    circumstance where it appears:

    (a) That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, a
    resolution of the stockholders or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the action
    asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or
    otherwise limits indemnification; or

    (b) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement.

# ARTICLE VII

# RECORDS AND REPORTS

**7.1.Maintenance And Inspection Of Records**

    The corporation shall, either at its principal executive offices or at such place or places as designated by the
    Board of Directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of
    shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books, and other records.

    Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath
    stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the
    corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts
    therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person's interest as a stockholder. In
    every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under
    oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent
    to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered
    office in Delaware or at its principal place of business.

    A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order
    for each class of stock and showing the address of each such stockholder and the number of shares registered in
    each such stockholder's name, shall be open to the examination of any such stockholder for a period of at least 10
    days prior to the meeting in the manner provided by law. The stock list shall also be open to the examination of
    any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting as provided by law. This list shall presumptively determine
    the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.

**7.2.Inspection By Directors**

    Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation's stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its
    other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director. The Court of
    Chancery is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the
    inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all
    books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in
    its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and
    further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

## ARTICLE VIII

### GENERAL MATTERS

**8.1.Checks**

    From time to time, the Board of Directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or
    endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are
    issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those
    instruments.

**8.2.Execution Of Corporate Contracts And Instruments**

    The Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers,
    or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the
    corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by
    the Board of Directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any
    power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it
    liable for any purpose or for any amount.

**8.3.Stock Certificates and Notices; Uncertificated Stock; Partly Paid
Shares**

    The shares of the corporation may be certificated or uncertificated, as provided under Delaware law, and
    shall be entered in the books of the corporation and recorded as they are issued. Any or all of the signatures on any
    certificate may be a facsimile or electronic signature. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has
    signed or whose facsimile or electronic signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer,
    transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect
    as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

    Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock and upon the request of a
    stockholder, the corporation shall send to the record owner thereof a written notice that shall set forth the name of
    the corporation, that the corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware, the name of the stockholder, the
    number and class (and the designation of the series, if any) of the shares, and any restrictions on the transfer or
    registration of such shares of stock imposed by the corporation's certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, any
    agreement among stockholders or any agreement between stockholders and the corporation.

    The corporation may issue the whole or any part of its shares as partly paid and subject to call for the
    remainder of the consideration to be paid therefor. Upon the face or back of each stock certificate (if any) issued to
    represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of
    uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid
    thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a
    dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration
    actually paid thereon.

**8.4.Special Designation On Certificates and Notices of Issuance**

    If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class,
    then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of
    each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or
    rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue
    to represent such class or series of stock or the notice of issuance to the record owner of uncertificated stock;
    provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the Delaware General Corporation Law,
    in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the
    corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock or the notice of issuance to the record owner of
    uncertificated stock, or the purchase agreement for such stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without
    charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative,
    participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications,
    limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

**8.5.Lost Certificates**

    Except as provided in this Section 8.5, no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously
    issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and cancelled at the same time. The
    corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or notice of uncertificated stock in the place of any certificate
    previously issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner
    of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or the owner's legal representative, to give the corporation a bond
    sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or
    destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

**8.6.Construction; Definitions**

    Unless the context requires otherwise, the general provisions, rules of construction, and definitions in the
    Delaware General Corporation Law shall govern the construction of these bylaws. Without limiting the generality
    of this provision, the singular number includes the plural, the plural number includes the singular, and the term
    "person" includes both a corporation and a natural person.

**8.7.Dividends**

    The directors of the corporation, subject to any restrictions contained in (a) the Delaware General
    Corporation Law or (b) the certificate of incorporation, may declare and pay dividends upon the shares of its
    capital stock. Dividends may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the corporation's capital stock.

    The directors of the corporation may set apart out of any of the funds of the corporation available for
    dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve. Such purposes shall
    include but not be limited to equalizing dividends, repairing or maintaining any property of the corporation, and
    meeting contingencies.

**8.8.Fiscal Year**

    The fiscal year of the corporation shall be fixed by resolution of the Board of Directors and may be changed
    by the Board of Directors.

**8.9.Transfer Restrictions**

    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, except as expressly permitted in this Section 8.9, a stockholder
    shall not Transfer (as such term is defined below) any shares of the corporation's stock (or any rights of or

    interests in such shares) to any person unless such Transfer is approved by the Board of Directors prior to such
    Transfer, which approval may be granted or withheld in the Board of Directors' sole and absolute discretion.
    "Transfer" shall mean, with respect to any security, the direct or indirect assignment, sale, transfer, tender, pledge,
    hypothecation, or the grant, creation or suffrage of a lien or encumbrance in or upon, or the gift, placement in
    trust, or the Constructive Sale (as such term is defined below) or other disposition of such security (including
    transfer by testamentary or intestate succession, merger or otherwise by operation of law) or any right, title or
    interest therein (including, but not limited to, any right or power to vote to which the holder thereof may be
    entitled, whether such right or power is granted by proxy or otherwise), or the record or beneficial ownership
    thereof, the offer to make such a sale, transfer, Constructive Sale or other disposition, and each agreement,
    arrangement or understanding, whether or not in writing, to effect any of the foregoing. "Constructive Sale" shall
    mean, with respect to any security, a short sale with respect to such security, entering into or acquiring an
    offsetting derivative contract with respect to such security, entering into or acquiring a futures or forward contract
    to deliver such security, or entering into any other hedging or other derivative transaction that has the effect of
    materially changing the economic benefits and risks of ownership. Any purported Transfer of any shares of the
    corporation's stock effected in violation of this Section 8.9 shall be null and void and shall have no force or effect
    and the corporation shall not register any such purported Transfer.

    Any stockholder seeking the approval of the Board of Directors of a Transfer of some or all of its shares shall
    give written notice thereof to the Secretary of the corporation that shall include: (a) the name of the stockholder;
    (b) the proposed transferee; (c) the number of shares of the Transfer of which approval is thereby requested; and
    (d) the purchase price (if any) of the shares proposed for Transfer. The corporation may require the stockholder to
    supplement its notice with such additional information as the corporation may request.

    Certificates representing, and in the case of uncertificated securities, notices of issuance with respect to,
    shares of stock of the corporation shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the
    following legend:

    THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REFERENCED HEREIN IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
    TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE COMPANY'S BYLAWS, COPIES OF WHICH MAY BE
    OBTAINED UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE COMPANY AT ITS PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS.
    THE COMPANY SHALL NOT REGISTER OR OTHERWISE RECOGNIZE OR GIVE EFFECT TO ANY
    PURPORTED TRANSFER OF SECURITIES THAT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH SUCH TRANSFER
    RESTRICTIONS.

    The corporation shall take all such actions as are practicable to cause the certificates representing, and
    notices of issuance with respect to, shares that are subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section to
    contain the foregoing legend.

**8.10.Transfer Of Stock**

    Upon receipt by the corporation or the transfer agent of the corporation of proper transfer instructions from
    the record holder of uncertificated shares or upon surrender to the corporation or the transfer agent of the
    corporation of a certificate for shares duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession, assignation
    or authority to transfer, it shall be the duty of the corporation to issue a new certificate or, in the case of
    uncertificated securities and upon request, a notice of issuance of shares, to the person entitled thereto, cancel the
    old certificate (if any) and record the transaction in its books.

**8.11.Stock Transfer Agreements**

    The corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement with any number of stockholders
    of any one or more classes of stock of the corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the corporation
    of any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not prohibited by the Delaware General
    Corporation Law.

**8.12.Stockholders of Record**

    The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person recorded on its books as the
    owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and
    assessments the person recorded on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any
    equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall
    have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Delaware.

**8.13.Facsimile or Electronic Signature**

    In addition to the provisions for use of facsimile or electronic signatures elsewhere specifically authorized in
    these bylaws, facsimile or electronic signatures of any stockholder, director or officer of the corporation may be
    used whenever and as authorized by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof.

## ARTICLE IX

### AMENDMENTS

The Bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the
stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation
may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt,
amend or repeal Bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has
been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders
of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws.
